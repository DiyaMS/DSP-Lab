Theory: 

Linear convolution is a mathematical operation used to combine two signals to produce 
a third signal. It's a fundamental operation in signal processing and systems theory. 
 
Mathematical Definition:  
 Given two signals, x(t) and h(t), their linear convolution is defined as:  
                    y(t) = x(t) * h(t) = ∫ 𝐱(𝛕)𝐡(𝐭−𝛕) 𝐝𝛕  
   
Applications:  
Filtering: Convolution is used to filter signals, removing unwanted frequencies 
or noise.  
System Analysis: The impulse response of a system completely characterizes its 
behaviour, and convolution can be used to determine the output of the system 
given a known input.  
Image Processing: Convolution is used for tasks like edge detection, blurring, 
and sharpening images.

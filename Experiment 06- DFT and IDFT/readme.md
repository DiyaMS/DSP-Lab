Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
 The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is a mathematical transformation used to analyze 
the frequency content of discrete signals. For a sequence x[n] of length N, the DFT is defined 
as:
𝑿[𝒌] = ∑ 𝒙[𝒏]
𝑵
𝒏=𝟎
⋅ 𝒆
−𝒋

𝑵
𝒏𝒌
, 𝒌 = 𝟎, 𝟏, 𝟐, . . . , 𝑵 −1
• X[k] is the DFT of the sequence x[n].
• The exponential factor represents 𝒆

• The DFT maps the time-domain signal into the frequency domain.
Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT)Method:
 The Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is used to convert a frequency-domain 
sequence X[k] back into its time-domain sequence x[n]. The IDFT is defined as:

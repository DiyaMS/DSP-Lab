Theory: 

The Sampling Theorem, also known as the Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem, states 
that a continuous signal can be completely reconstructed from its samples if the 
sampling frequency is greater than twice the highest frequency present in the signal. 
This critical frequency is known as the Nyquist rate.  
fs ≥ 2⋅fmax  
Where:  
• fs is the sampling frequency (rate at which the signal is sampled),  
• fmax is the highest frequency present in the signal.  
  
Applications:  
• Digital audio and video processing  
• Communication systems  
• Image processing  
• Medical imaging
